# Railway-Management-System
This project is basically concerned with the scheduling of trains and ticketing . The need of this system arose because we know that India has a very large
railway network and to handle it manually with precision is not possible . Computerizing it will increase the reliability , speed , efficiency and will 
decrease the paper work 

This project consists of 4 windows :
1. Project (main) window 
2. Admin window 
3. Customer window
